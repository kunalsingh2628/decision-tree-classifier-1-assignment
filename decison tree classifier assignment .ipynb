    "The geometric intuition behind decision tree classification involves dividing the feature space into regions or decision regions, where each region corresponds to a particular class label. This process creates a set of hyperplanes that partition the input space based on the values of different features. The decision boundaries are orthogonal to the axes, aligning with the feature values.\n",

    "Here's how the geometric intuition of decision tree classification works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Regions:\n",
    "\n",
    "At each node of the decision tree, the algorithm selects a feature and a threshold to split the dataset into two subsets. This split creates a decision boundary in the feature space, effectively dividing it into two regions.\n",
    "Recursive Partitioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree continues to recursively partition the feature space at each node, creating more decision boundaries and finer decision regions. The process results in a hierarchical structure where each leaf node represents a specific region.\n",
    "Orthogonal Decision Boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision boundaries in a decision tree are orthogonal to the axes. This means that at each split, the algorithm chooses a feature and a threshold such that the decision boundary is a vertical or horizontal line. This orthogonality simplifies the decision-making process and makes the tree structure interpretable.\n",
    "Leaf Nodes as Decision Regions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final decision regions are associated with the leaf nodes of the tree. When a new instance is presented to the model, it traverses the tree from the root to a leaf, following the decisions at each node. The class label associated with the leaf node reached by the instance becomes the prediction.\n",
    "Capturing Non-linear Decision Boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the simplicity of individual decision boundaries, decision trees can capture complex and non-linear decision regions when multiple nodes are combined. By recursively partitioning the feature space, decision trees can approximate intricate decision boundaries that may not be easily achievable with a single linear model.\n",
    "Geometrically, a decision tree divides the input space into regions that are homogenous with respect to the class labels. The algorithm learns to make decisions based on the values of features, and the resulting tree structure reflects the hierarchical organization of these decisions in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This geometric intuition makes decision trees particularly useful for visualizing and understanding the relationships within the data, as the decision boundaries are easily interpretable and can be represented graphically. However, it's important to note that decision trees may suffer from overfitting, and techniques like pruning are often applied to prevent the model from becoming too complex and fitting the noise in the data.\n",

In this example, a precision of 80% indicates that when the model predicts positive, it is correct 80% of the time. A recall of 85.7% indicates that the model captures 85.7% of the actual positive instances. The F1 score takes into account both precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's overall performance.\n",
